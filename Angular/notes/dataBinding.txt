WHat is DataBinding?
DataBinding means transformering data between Template and component files.
There is two types of dataBinding.

     --Using one way dataBinding we can Transfer data either template to component or component to template.There are 3  possible way:
        a. String Interpolation: 
          --we can send the data to component (TS) to Template(HTML) using sting Interpolation.
          --It wraps the data between double braces.
          --String Interpolation always takes value as string.
        b. Property Binding:
          --we can bind property values from component file to Template file using property binding, it wraps the data in between squre brackets.
          --property binding can be used for dynamic class or dynamic styling.
        c. Event Binding:
